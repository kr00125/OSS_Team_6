Hello, 
This project is using Arduino and Processing.
Our team project begin April, 2016.
The porject is about that library noise protect campaign.
It prints out cuty bear in screen by noise degree.
In normal time, cuty bear is smile face.
If noise degree rise high level, you can see angry bear with red background.
Please do not make him angry. Keep calm and just study hard.
We use Arduino UNO, and it checks noise by Arduino sound sensor 'MaX4466'.
It is protected by GPL license. Thank you.
